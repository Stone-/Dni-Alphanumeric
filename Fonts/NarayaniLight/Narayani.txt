What's new?

1.10 - Finally, first public release.
1.00 - This is an unofficial, secret test-release.

What is it anyway?
------------------
"Narayani Light" (the "light" is referring to the thickness of the
strokes) is a True Type Font for writing Narayani words as seen in
Myst III: Exile.

The puzzle to lower the shields in Narayan show you how the symbols are
made up:

Four overlapping circles (or rings, if you prefer) of the same size resting
inside a bigger circle. Each of those five circles is subdivided into four
segments. That means there's a total of twenty segments ( 5 * 4 ).
And since each segment can independently be there or not there
(on or off = 2 states), there are 2 ^ 20 = 1048576 possible symbols.
However, many of those 1048576 look nearly identical, which does make this
system quite impractical compared to our letter-based alphabets.

It would be nearly impossible (and quite stupid) to make a font with
1048576 glyphs.  So I just included the twenty segments into this font.


"Narayani Roman Light" is a completely different font, made for writing
English and other languages which use Roman/Latin based letters. All of
its small and capital letters, plus some of the other symbols, are made by
strictly using the Narayani pattern. I think no further explanation is
required, just test it.

The rest of this document will be referring to "Narayani Light".




Important Usage Notes
---------------------
When typing a letter with this font, the cursor doesn't advance, that's
how the segments can overlap each other and form a complete symbol.
This has several consequences:

1) You have to manually make the cursor advance by typing an underscore (_)
   directly after a completed symbol. Optionally you could use two spaces ( )
   as well (the space produced by underscore is twice the widthe as the normal
   space). However, it's recommended to use the underscore.
2) The font may look bad on screen due to the overlaying of multiple contours.
   Parts of the symbols can disappear, become transparent or at worst the
   fragments can be displayed next to each other instead of overlaying each other.
   However, when being rendered by a graphics program or when printed, the font
   should appear correctly.

The font is not case sensitive.
Typing "ABCD" or "aBcD" has the same result as "abcd".
Lowercase is recommended, though.

Furthermore, the order in which you enter letters to produce a symbol doesn't
matter either. "acdehijors", "adchejiros" or any other permutation will give
you the symbol for the word "nature" (don't forget the final underscore! ;-).
However, I recommend alphabetical ordering.



Character mapping:
------------------
See the "mapping.gif" image.

0 = Narayani symbol for 0
1 = Narayani symbol for 1
2 = Narayani symbol for 2
3 = Narayani symbol for 3
4 = Narayani symbol for 4
5 = Narayani symbol for 5
6 = J'nanin
7 = Amateria
8 = Edanna
9 = Voltaic
! = "RivenSquee", courtesy of Night Sky (aka. Ohvhil)

) = Narayani symbol for 10 (Shift+0)
= = Narayani symbol for 10 (Shift+0 on a German keyboard ;-)




Shortcuts (use them!):
----------------------
abcd = u
efgh = v
ijkl = w
mnop = x
qrst = y

uvwxy = z




Explanation of the Narayani number system:
------------------------------------------
In Narayani you count like this:

zero		= 0
one		= 1
two		= 2
three		= 3
four		= 4
five		= 5
six		= 51
seven		= 52
eight		= 53
nine		= 54
ten		= )
eleven		= )1
twelve		= )2
thirteen	= )3
fourteen	= )4
fifteen		= )5
sixteen		= )51
seventeen	= )52
eighteen	= )53
nineteen	= )54
twenty		= ))
etc...

So to write the number nine, you type "54" which gives you the symbol for
five next to the symbol for four. You never type two fives next to each
other, instead you use the symbol for ten.

To Do:
------
* a decent readme/documentation in HTML format would be nice. ;-)
* maybe a another version of the font with thicker strokes. The
  current version is called Narayani LIGHT after all.
